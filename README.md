# COMP2007 Main Project - To Save a Tree
The Github for my COMP2007 Game To Save a Tree - A collecting game.

All 3D asstes/textures used in the game were designed and created by me using Blender abd Affinity Designer respectfully, as well as all code, shaders, visual effects and UI elements.

The audio found within the game was sourced from the Unity Asset Store.

Character animations were provided by Mixamo.
